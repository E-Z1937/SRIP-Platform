## Overview

SRIP transforms business intelligence through four specialized AI agents that conduct comprehensive market research, competitive analysis, and strategic planning. Built with LangGraph orchestration and optimized for enterprise deployment, the system delivers executive-ready reports in under 60 seconds.

### Key Capabilities

- **Market Intelligence**: Industry trends, market sizing, growth opportunities
- **Competitive Analysis**: Positioning assessment, competitive landscape mapping
- **Risk Evaluation**: Quantified risk scoring with mitigation strategies  
- **Strategic Advisory**: Executive recommendations and action planning

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent System Design

![SRIP Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E-Z1937/SRIP-Platform/main/architecture-diagram.svg)

The system orchestrates four specialized agents through LangGraph:

| Agent | Function | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Market Intelligence Agent** | Industry analysis, market trends, growth projections | Market size, drivers, opportunities |
| **Competitive Intelligence Agent** | Competitive positioning, landscape mapping | Market share, advantages, vulnerabilities |
| **Risk Assessment Agent** | Strategic risk evaluation with 1-10 scoring | Quantified risks, mitigation strategies |
| **Strategic Advisor Agent** | Executive recommendations, action planning | 6-8 strategic recommendations, executive summary |

### Technical Stack

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph for agent coordination
- **LLM Integration**: Groq API with multi-model fallbacks
- **Interface**: Gradio web application
- **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces cloud hosting

## Performance Metrics

Based on production testing:

- **Processing Time**: 15-90 seconds for complete analysis
- **Success Rate**: 100% quality score capability
- **Content Delivery**: 5/5 sections completed consistently
- **Strategic Output**: 6-8 actionable recommendations per analysis

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/E-Z1937/SRIP-Platform.git
cd SRIP-Platform

source srip-env/bin/activate  # Windows: srip-env\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration

Create `.env` file with your Groq API key:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Get free API key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) (14,400 requests/day free tier)

## API Reference

### Core Analysis Function
```python
def execute_complete_analysis(query: str, targets: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Run comprehensive business intelligence analysis
    
    Args:
        query: Strategic research question
        targets: Comma-separated analysis focus areas
        
    Returns:
        (formatted_report, status_message)
    """
```

## System Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Internet connection for API calls
- Groq API key (free tier sufficient)
- 2GB RAM minimum for local deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Error**
```bash
# Verify environment variable is set
echo $GROQ_API_KEY
```

**Processing Timeout**
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key validity
- Retry with simpler query

**Quality Issues** 
- Ensure query is business-focused and specific
- Provide clear analysis targets when possible
- Review example queries for optimal formatting
