# Business Intelligence Analysis Error

**Query:** {query if 'query' in locals() else 'Unknown'}
**Analysis Duration:** {processing_time:.1f} seconds  
**Error Category:** {type(e).__name__}
**Error Details:** {error_details[:400]}
**Timestamp:** {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}

## System Status Assessment
- Input Processing: {'Completed' if 'query' in locals() else 'Failed'}
- Agent Orchestration: Error encountered during execution
- API Connectivity: Under diagnostic review
- Content Generation: Interrupted by system error

## Business Continuity Actions
1. Verify query contains specific business intelligence requirements
2. Ensure analysis targets are properly formatted (comma-separated)
3. Reduce query complexity if addressing very broad market scope
4. Retry analysis after brief interval for system recovery
5. Contact technical support if errors persist beyond retry attempts

## Technical Recovery
System diagnostic protocols are active. Automated recovery procedures will optimize 
performance parameters for subsequent analysis requests.
